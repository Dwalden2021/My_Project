# RPGLE

RPG is a bit different to work, it is in what I is refered to as green screen. Also when not in free format, part of the syntax is based in the columns the characters and tags are in.

### Here is and example of _Hello World_ in RPGLE
```
//free
dsply 'Hello World';
return;
```

Things that I like about RPG: 
* I like RPGLE free vs structured
* RPG is a very powerful

Things I do not enjoy about RPG:
* LEGACY CODE!! It is simply the worst to work in or upgrade
