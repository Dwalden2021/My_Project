# CLLE


Hello world would not be coded in CL, it would be coded into a RPGLE program or a display file.  Then the RPGLE or Display file would be called by the CL PGM, executed, and then control returned to the CL. 

CLLE is also displayed in _green screen_:

**What I like about CL:**
* I like the structure it offers to RPGLE
* All the heavy lifting is still done by the RPG programs, but the structure and order is maintained by the CL PGM
* Running simple command line commands is simple and easy in a CL PGM
