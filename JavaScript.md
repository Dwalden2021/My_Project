# Javascript

Javascript has been very fun to learn and I have come to realize how often it is used.  I has been a great puzzle piece to fit into what I already know.

### Here is and example of _Hello World_ in Javascript
```
document.write('Hello, world!');
```

**What I like about Javascript:**
* The use and integration to websites
* I use it at work for changing the titles of all my tabs
* Web Scraping to clipboard is very useful and easy

For more information, here is the  [Javascript Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) site
