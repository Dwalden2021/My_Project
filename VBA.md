# VBA

VBA is something that I started using in Excel. I used it converted txt into the format that I needed, then I exported it to a .TXT file. It was my first step through the door.  I like the easy and quick through together GUI for easy or testing projects.

### Here is and example of _Hello World_ in VBA
```
Sub hello()
 MsgBox "Hello World - Excel VBA here"
End Sub
```

I like to use VBA for the following applications:
* Excel
* Word
* Outlook
