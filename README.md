## Welcome, My name is Devon and here is my page!

I have not been a Programmer for most of my carrer.  I spent most of my time working with Wal-mart. Eventually I started working in the computer room.  I got tired of imputting labels by hand, so I started using Excel to convert emails and .TXT files into a format they could be read.  The rest is history, now I work for a software company and and I am pursing a bachelors in IT.  

### Here are some of the Programming languages that I have been known to dabble in:
* VBA
* RPGLE
* CLLE
* Javascript
* Python
